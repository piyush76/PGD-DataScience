How many types of ensemble techniques ? 
- Bagging and Boosting


- Ensemble Technique is all about you pick multiple models and combine them to get the right pridections. We create n different models and each one of them are different than each other. 
- We believe than having multiple models for predections is better than have one. 
- The whole idea is by combining the models which have accuracy of 90% we can get the right predictions. 
- Models should be independent of one another. 
- Ensemble techniques can be used for both Regression as well as classification.
