Random Variable :
A random variable is a variable whose value is determined by the outcome of a random experiment.


Discrete Random Variable:
A random variable that assumes countable values is called a discrete random variable.

Probability Distribution of a Discrete Random Variable The probability distribution of a discrete random variable lists all the possible values that the random variable can assume and their cor-
responding probabilities.

Continuous Random Variable :
A random variable that can assume any value contained in one or more intervals is called a continuous random variable.


Number of Combinations : 
The number of combinations for selecting x from n distinct elements is given by the formula

where n!, x!, and (n  x)! are read as “n factorial,” “x factorial,” and “n minus x factorial,”
respectively.

		n!
nCx = --------
	  x!(n-x)!


Permutations Formula :
The following formula is used to find the number of permutations or arrangements of selecting x items out of n items. Note that here, the n items should all be different.

	   n!
nPx = ---------
	  (n - x)!

Conditions of a Binomial Experiment A binomial experiment must satisfy the following four
conditions.

1. There are n identical trials.
2. Each trial has only two possible outcomes.
3. The probabilities of the two outcomes remain constant.
4. The trials are independent.


Binomial probability distribution formula

             x  (n-x)
P(x2) =	nCx	p  q

where

n  total number of trials
p  probability of success
q  (1-p)  probability of failure
x  number of successes in n trials
n-x number of failures in n trials
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Normal Probability Distribution A normal probability distribution, when plotted, gives a bellshaped
curve such that:
1. The total area under the curve is 1.0.
2. The curve is symmetric about the mean.
3. The two tails of the curve extend indefinitely.


The standard normal distribution is a special case of the normal distribution. For the standard normal distribution, the value of the mean is equal to zero, and the value of the standard
deviation is equal to 1.


The Z Score Formula:

z = (x – μ) / σ

For example, let’s say you have a test score of 190. The test has a mean (μ) of 150 and a standard deviation (σ) of 25. Assuming a normal distribution, your z score would be:
z = (x – μ) / σ
z =(190 – 150) / 25 = 1.6
